# Why we need to go to school?

I am nearly 28 years old and almost all of my time is in academia, or said school. I have met lots of people(Chinese, European) and they have different answers to this question.


## The first is my answer: 

From kinderdgarten to high school(2000-2014), I went to school because my mom required me. 

My mom always told me that study is the only way you can have a good future. Also, the teacher, the relatives, every adult have the same opinion. I guess the main reason is the generation of my parents(born around 1960), if someone can go to university, the government will offer their work directly. Since the educated people during the last centuries of China is seldom. During 2000-2014, I just followed what my parents required me to do, not too much passion, the goal is make my mom happy. 

From 2014 to now, 2024. The main reason for me to keeping study is lack of security and curiority to this world. 
China has so many people and you need to have a good diploma to find a job. This is what I thought before 2018. After that, my mind changed. The reason is below from one book named ‘Study in Cambridge and Oxford’ (https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/501187754) :

William Cory, the schoolmaster-poet, gave his views on the purpose of education in his paper Eton Reform II.

“At school you are engaged not so much in acquiring knowledge as in making mental efforts under criticism.

“A certain amount of knowledge you can indeed with average faculties acquire so as to retain; nor need you regret the hours you spent on much that is forgotten, for the shadow of lost knowledge at least protects you from many illusions.

“But you go to a great school not so much for knowledge as for arts and habits; for the habit of attention, for the art of expression, for the art of assuming at a moment’s notice a new intellectual position, for the art of entering quickly into another person’s thoughts, for the habit of submitting to censure and refutation, for the art of indicating assent or dissent in graduated terms, for the habit of regarding minute points of accuracy, for the art of working out what is possible in a given time, for taste, for discrimination, for mental courage, and for mental soberness.”
