## Why have thisblog?

1：I love reading, also like to discuss different kinds of topics with different people. I had a blog before, which is based on Wechat platform and not too many peopele discuss. Wechat is a social place, not suit for blog.

2：Need to practice my english. I have completed self learning courses in the British Council, which froms level A1 to C1. Starting in March 2022 to Feb 2024, almost two years. Almost 90% 'everyday' I was learning. Now I am more confident about English. 

3：Maybe helpful for some people, especially in remote village of China, who lack of education resources. No one will go there to have speech to introduce their latest product or idea, there are not any book exhibition, while I feel they are the most demand for education.

4：For memory. No matter how good a brain it is, a pen is always better to markdown things.
